                        <li><span>1935</span> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps,<br> helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li><br>

                        <li><span>1941</span>- Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected.<br> Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control<br> malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science</li><br>
                        <li><span>1942</span> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li><br>
                        <li><span>1944</span> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant<br> wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over<br> the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of <br>disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li><br>
                        <li><span>1945</span> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, <br>doubling wheat yields</li><br>
                        <li><span>1953</span> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American<br> breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to <br>provide 95% of Mexico's wheat</li><br>
                        <li><span>1962</span> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian<br> subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li><br>
                        <li><span>1970</span> - receives the nobel Peace Prize</li><br>
                        <li><span> 1983</span>b - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yield</li><br>
                        <li><span> 1984</span> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li><br>
                        <li><span> 2005</span> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that<br> genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run<br> out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because<br> "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for<br> a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds.</li><br>
                        <li><span> 2009</span> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
